# 🔐 Simple Password Strength Checker

## 📋 Project Description
**Password Strength Checker** is a Python application designed to thoroughly analyze and evaluate password strength. This project aims to assess password security using various metrics and analysis algorithms from Python. (INDONESIAN VERSION)

## ✨ Main Features
- 🔍 Password Complexity Analysis
- 📏 Password Length Verification
- 🧮 Password Entropy Calculation
- 🚨 Weak Password Identification
- 📊 Password Strength Scoring
- 🛡️ Security Recommendations

## 🎯 Objectives
This project aims to:
- Help you create strong passwords
- Enhance digital security awareness
- Provide easy guidance in password creation

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- No additional external libraries required
